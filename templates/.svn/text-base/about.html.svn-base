				<p>One day we were in Mendocino, California talking to a man named Paul, who is a long time coffee roaster and the founder of <a href="http://www.thanksgivingcoffee.com" target="_blank">Thanksgiving Coffee</a>.  We listened with open hearts to his philosophy on environmental change, Nicaraguan coffee growing, the meaning of life and how young people can change the world.  After that conversation, we decided that we (as individuals, friends and family members) needed an easy way to see the everyday problems and more importantly the everyday solutions that were available to environmental issues.  Our answer is the Sustainable Bucket - a simple way to get ourselves and other people to vote with their money and start buying sustainable products.</p>

				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| Have you ever said or heard something like: 'I'd like to be more green but I'm not sure how?' |<br />  
                 We found ourselves in the same position.  So we began with an idea - let's figure out what we can control and what we can't. About 3 minutes later, we had a list [insert link]. About 2 minutes after that, we realized that most of the environmental impact you have has to do with what you buy and consume everyday. Since one of us is of the analytical nature (Bill) - we ran some numbers [insert link].  The solution at that point was pretty clear, we had to reprogram our buying habits, thus the Sustainable Bucket was born. The Sustainable Bucket was created to get ourselves and others on the right track with their purchasing and consumption habits.  When we started creating buckets we found easy, sustainable substitutes at reasonable prices for everything.  </p>

				<p>'Hi, I'm Bill.' 'and I'm Lane.'  There, intros are done, nice to meet you.  Thanks for checking out Sustainable Bucket.  We're excited you're even on the site, hopefully you can learn something, cause we've already learned a lot from you all.  We're the two random friends from the story you read above.  We doubt you're wondering this, but if you are, we're from the west and east coast of the United States respectively. In our spare time, we work at a technology company in the Silicon Valley in California.
